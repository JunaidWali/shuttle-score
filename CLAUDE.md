## Project Overview
- We're building a badminton score tracking app

## Design Principles
- Keep the UI design as minimal as possible
- Keep the UI sleek, modern, minimal, cool, and full of rounded corners
- Pitch black background with colorful cards as part of UI

## Session and Scoring
- Also the past games are for only that session
- A session is basically around 2-2.5 hours at the court
- We switch players and play multiple games and keep score
